Scaling code
------------
=> A fight against complexity.

At a certain point the code base does not find
anymore into one person's head. Complexity removes
all your velocity.

**Abstraction**: Reduce the size of any single component
and create a set of subsystems allowing specialization
where necessary. Those subsystems need to be glued 
together=> A fight against complexity.
